By properly maintaining your Traeger grill, you can extend its lifespan significantly.</p>
<h3 id="3-frequency-of-use">3. Frequency of Use</h3>
<p>How often you use your Traeger grill can impact its lifespan.

<li><strong>Protect from the elements</strong>: While Traeger grills are designed to withstand outdoor conditions, covering them with a quality grill cover will shield them from harsh weather, prolonging their lifespan.</li>
<li><strong>Professional servicing</strong>: If you&rsquo;re unsure about maintaining your grill or notice any issues, it&rsquo;s wise to seek professional servicing to ensure optimal performance and longevity.</li>
</ul>
