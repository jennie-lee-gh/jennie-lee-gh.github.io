## What You'll Need

Before we dive into the heating instructions, make sure you have the following tools and ingredients handy:

- Spinelli's Steaks (of your choice)
- Oven or grill
- Meat thermometer
- Aluminum foil
- Salt and pepper (optional)
- Marinating sauce or seasoning (optional)

## Preparing Your Steaks

1. Start by preheating your oven or grill to a medium-high heat. If using an oven, set the temperature to 400°F (200°C). For grilling, make sure the grill is clean and hot.

2. If you're using frozen Spinelli's Steaks, quickly defrost them in the microwave following the package instructions. Note that it's always best to thaw steaks in the refrigerator overnight for optimum results.

3. Once the steaks are thawed, pat them dry gently using paper towels. This ensures a better sear and prevents excess moisture.

4. At this point, you can choose to season your steaks with salt, pepper, or your favorite steak seasoning. However, since Spinelli's Steaks are already marinated and seasoned, this step is optional.

## Heating Your Steaks

### Oven Method

1. Place the steaks on a baking sheet or oven-safe dish lined with aluminum foil. Keep some space between them to ensure even cooking.

2. Put the steaks in the preheated oven and cook for approximately 10-15 minutes, depending on the steak's thickness and desired level of doneness. 

3. To check the internal temperature, insert a meat thermometer in the thickest part of the steak: 
  - Medium-rare: 135°F (57°C)
  - Medium: 145°F (63°C)
  - Medium-well: 150°F (66°C)
  - Well done: 160°F (71°C)

4. Once your steak reaches your desired temperature, remove it from the oven and let it rest for a few minutes. This allows the meat to redistribute its juices, resulting in a more flavorful and tender steak.

### Grilling Method

1. Preheat your grill to a medium-high heat. Aim for a temperature of around 450°F (230°C).

2. Place the steaks directly on the hot grill grates and close the lid.

3. Grill the steaks for approximately 4-6 minutes on each side, depending on thickness and desired level of doneness. Use the meat thermometer to check the internal temperature.

4. Similar to the oven method, let the steaks rest for a few minutes after grilling.

## Serving and Enjoying

Once your Spinelli's Steaks are cooked and rested, it's time to serve and savor! Here are a few tips for that perfect steak experience:

- Slice the steak against the grain for maximum tenderness.
- Serve your steak with your favorite side dishes like roasted potatoes, grilled vegetables, or a fresh salad.
- If desired, drizzle some melted butter or steak sauce over the steak for an extra burst of flavor.

Remember, the cooking times mentioned above are just a guideline. Adjust them based on the thickness of your steaks and your personal preference for doneness.

Now that you're armed with these heating instructions, you can easily recreate the magic of Spinelli's Steaks in your very own kitchen. So, fire up your oven or grill, follow these steps, and indulge in a restaurant-style steak experience without leaving your home. Happy cooking and enjoy your delicious meal!

*Note: Always follow the specific heating instructions mentioned on the packaging of your Spinelli's Steaks for the best results.
