Barbecue competitions are fierce battles where only the best flavors can emerge victorious. When it comes to competition-worthy ribs, Heath Riles has risen to legendary status. In this article, we'll unlock the secrets behind Heath Riles' winning rib recipe, so you too can create outstanding ribs that conquer any barbecue challenge.

## Ingredients

To begin your journey to rib success, gather the following ingredients:

- 2 racks of baby back ribs
- 1/4 cup of Heath Riles' Honey Rub
- 1/4 cup of Heath Riles' Garlic Jalapeño Rub
- 1/4 cup of brown sugar
- 1/4 cup of honey
- 1/4 cup of butter
- 1/4 cup of apple juice
- BBQ sauce of your choice

## Instructions

1. Start by preparing your smoker or grill for indirect cooking at a temperature of 250°F (120°C).

2. Carefully remove the membrane from the back of the ribs. This step is crucial as it allows the flavors to penetrate the meat more effectively.

3. Apply a generous coating of Heath Riles' Honey Rub to both sides of the ribs. Make sure to massage the rub into the meat for maximum flavor absorption.

4. Sprinkle Heath Riles' Garlic Jalapeño Rub onto the ribs, enhancing the taste with a delicious kick.

5. Let the rubbed ribs rest at room temperature for about 30 minutes to allow the flavors to merge.

6. Once your smoker or grill is ready, place the ribs bone side down and smoke them for approximately 3 hours. Ensure a constant temperature and a steady flow of smoke, using wood chips of your choice.

7. While the ribs are cooking, prepare the glaze by melting the butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Add the brown sugar, honey, and apple juice to the pan, allowing everything to blend together and create a caramel-like consistency. Stir occasionally to prevent burning.

8. After 3 hours, it's time to baste the ribs with the glaze. Generously brush the glaze onto both sides of the ribs, ensuring an even coat.

9. Wrap each rack of ribs in aluminum foil, forming a tight seal to lock in the flavors. Return the wrapped ribs to the smoker or grill for an additional 2 hours of cooking.

10. Once the cooking time is complete, carefully remove the racks from the foil and place them back on the smoker or grill, bone side down. Brush your favorite barbecue sauce on the ribs and allow them to cook for an additional 30 minutes, giving the sauce a chance to caramelize.

11. Finally, remove the ribs from the smoker or grill and let them rest for approximately 10 minutes before serving. This resting period allows the juices to redistribute, resulting in tender, juicy ribs.

12. Slice and serve Heath Riles' Competition Ribs to appreciative guests, fellow competitors, or even esteemed barbecue judges.

## Conclusion

Mastering the art of competition-worthy ribs is no small feat. However, with Heath Riles' proven recipe, you have all the tools you need to elevate your barbecue game to the winner's circle. By combining the aromatic spices of the Honey Rub and Garlic Jalapeño Rub, along with the mouthwatering glaze, you can create ribs that are juicy, flavorful, and irresistible.

So fire up your smoker, get your ribs ready, and let Heath Riles' Competition Ribs recipe make you the star of your next barbecue competition. The only thing left to do is taste victory!
