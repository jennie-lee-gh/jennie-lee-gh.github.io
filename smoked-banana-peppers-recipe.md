  - Cooked ground sausage or chorizo
  - Minced garlic
  - Chopped fresh herbs (cilantro, parsley, or basil)

## Instructions

### Step 1: Prepare the Smoker

1. Preheat your smoker to a temperature of 225°F (107°C). Use your choice of wood chips or chunks to infuse smokiness into the peppers. Hickory and mesquite are popular choices that complement the peppers' robust flavors.

### Step 2: Prep the Banana Peppers

1. Gently wash the banana peppers under cold water, ensuring all dirt and debris are removed.
2. Slice off the tops of the peppers and remove the seeds and membranes. This step allows for stuffing if desired.
3. Optional: If stuffing the peppers, mix your chosen fillings together in a bowl until well combined.

### Step 3: Season the Peppers

1. Drizzle olive oil over the peppers, ensuring they are evenly coated.
2. Sprinkle salt and pepper over them, according to your taste preferences.

### Step 4: Smoke the Peppers

1. Place the banana peppers on the preheated smoker racks, spacing them out to allow for even smoking.
2. Close the smoker, adjusting the vents as needed to maintain a steady smoking temperature.
3. Smoke the peppers for 2-3 hours, or until they reach your desired level of tenderness and smoky flavor.

### Step 5: Serve and Enjoy

1. Remove the smoked banana peppers from the smoker, allowing them to cool for a few minutes.
2. If stuffed, garnish with additional toppings such as fresh herbs or shredded cheese.
3. Serve as an appetizer, side dish, or even incorporate them into your favorite recipes.
4. Enjoy the fusion of spiciness and smokiness in each flavorful bite!

## Tips and variations

- If you prefer more heat, choose hotter banana pepper varieties or add crushed red pepper flakes while seasoning.
- Create your own unique fillings by incorporating different cheeses, meats, or vegetables into the cream cheese mixture.
- Feel free to experiment with the smoking time to achieve your desired level of firmness or tenderness in the peppers.
- Serve smoked banana peppers alongside grilled meats, as a topping for burgers, or as a pizza topping for an extra kick.
- These peppers can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to a week.
