Smoking seafood is a delicious way to infuse delicate flavors into your favorite dishes. If you're a seafood lover, you'll be thrilled to learn how to smoke scallops on a pellet grill. With its precise temperature control and natural smoky flavor, the pellet grill offers an ideal cooking environment for achieving succulent, perfectly smoked scallops. In this article, we'll guide you through the process step-by-step, ensuring exceptional results every time.

## **Choosing the Scallops**

To begin, ensure you pick fresh, high-quality scallops. Fresh scallops have a firm texture, smell clean and briny, and have a sweet taste. Select scallops that are evenly sized for consistent cooking. Keep in mind that smaller scallops cook faster, while larger ones take a bit longer to achieve that perfect tenderness.

## **Prepping the Scallops**

Before seasoning the scallops, make sure to rinse them thoroughly and pat them dry. This helps remove any excess moisture and allows the seasonings to stick better. 

Next, you can choose to marinate the scallops or simply season them directly. A simple yet flavorful combination is olive oil, lemon juice, minced garlic, salt, and black pepper. Gently coat the scallops with the marinade/seasoning mixture, ensuring all sides are covered evenly. Let them marinate for about 15-30 minutes, allowing the flavors to penetrate.

## **Preparing the Pellet Grill**

Now it's time to fire up your pellet grill. Fill the hopper with your preferred wood pellets – lighter, fruitier wood such as apple or cherry pairs well with scallops. Preheat the grill to a temperature of around 225-250°F (107-121°C). This temperature range provides the perfect balance between imparting a smoky flavor and maintaining the scallops' delicate texture.

## **Smoking the Scallops**

Once the grill is preheated, carefully place the seasoned scallops directly onto the grill grates. You can use a grill mat to prevent the scallops from falling through the grates. Leave some space between the scallops for even airflow and to help them cook evenly.

Close the lid and let the scallops smoke for about 30 minutes. Avoid opening the lid frequently to retain the smoke and heat inside, ensuring consistent cooking. Smoking time may vary based on the size of the scallops and personal preference, so it's best to check for doneness using visual cues.

## **Checking for Doneness**

When the scallops are ready, they should have a beautiful opaque white color with a slight sear on the outside. Using tongs, gently press on a scallop to check for firmness. Properly cooked scallops should have a slightly firm texture and spring back when touched. Overcooking can result in rubbery scallops, so it's important to monitor their progress.

## **Serving Suggestions**

Smoked scallops can be enjoyed on their own as an appetizer or incorporated into various culinary creations. Here are a few serving suggestions to inspire your culinary journey:

1. **Scallop Skewers**: Thread the smoked scallops onto skewers, alternating with colorful veggies. Grill them for a few minutes on high heat for a delightful smoky kebab experience.

2. **Scallop Pasta**: Toss the smoked scallops with al dente pasta, garlic, butter, and your favorite herbs for a rich and indulgent seafood pasta dish.

3. **Scallop Salad**: Combine smoked scallops with a mix of fresh greens, cherry tomatoes, avocado, and a tangy vinaigrette for a light and refreshing salad.

4. **Scallop Tacos**: Stuff smoky scallops into warm tortillas, together with crunchy slaw, creamy avocado, and zesty lime crema, for a fantastic seafood taco feast.

Experiment with different flavor profiles, sauces, and sides to cater to your personal taste preferences and create exciting dishes that highlight the smoky essence of the scallops.

## **Final Tips and Tricks**

- Opt for dry-pack scallops, as they contain no chemical additives or preservatives.
- Avoid overcrowding the grill to allow proper airflow and even cooking.
- A meat thermometer will help ensure the scallops are the desired internal temperature of 145°F (63°C).
- For an extra layer of flavor, add a small chunk of your favorite smoking wood directly onto the grill.
- Remember to clean your pellet grill thoroughly after use to maintain optimal performance.

Now that you have mastered the art of smoking scallops on a pellet grill, it's time to wow your family and friends with your newfound skills. Enjoy the mouthwatering results and savor the delicate smoky flavors that take scallops to a whole new level of culinary excellence.
