This savory recipe brings together the smoky goodness of grilling with the comforting and satisfying tastes of a classic meatloaf. So, fire up your Green Egg and get ready for a one-of-a-kind gastronomic experience.

## Why Choose the Green Egg?

Before we dive into the recipe, let's take a moment to appreciate the Green Egg itself. Known as a kamado-style ceramic grill, the Green Egg is renowned for its exceptional heat retention and versatility. With precise temperature control and the ability to reach both high heat for searing and low heat for slow cooking, the Green Egg is the grill of choice for many grilling aficionados.

## Preparing the Perfect Meatloaf

To begin, let's gather the ingredients you'll need to create a delectable meatloaf on the Green Egg:

- 2 pounds of ground beef (a mix of lean and fatty beef is ideal)
- 1 cup of breadcrumbs
- 1/2 cup of grated Parmesan cheese
- 1/2 cup of milk
- 2 large eggs
- 1 small onion, finely chopped
- 2 cloves of garlic, minced
- 2 tablespoons of ketchup
- 1 tablespoon of Worcestershire sauce
- 1 tablespoon of Dijon mustard
- 1 teaspoon of dried parsley
- 1 teaspoon of dried oregano
- 1 teaspoon of dried thyme
- Salt and pepper to taste

## Steps to Grilling Perfection

1. Preheat your Green Egg to 350°F (175°C) using indirect heat. Place a drip pan filled with water below the cooking grates to create a moist cooking environment.
2. In a large bowl, combine the ground beef, breadcrumbs, Parmesan cheese, milk, eggs, onion, garlic, ketchup, Worcestershire sauce, Dijon mustard, dried parsley, dried oregano, dried thyme, salt, and pepper. Mix the ingredients thoroughly but avoid overworking the meat.
3. Shape the mixture into a loaf on a rimmed baking sheet or a cooling rack with handles that allows easy transport onto the Green Egg.
4. Once the Green Egg has reached the desired temperature, place the meatloaf on the cooking grates. Close the lid and cook for approximately 1 to 1 1/2 hours until the internal temperature reaches 160°F (71°C).
5. For some added flavor, you can glaze the meatloaf with your favorite barbecue sauce during the last 15 minutes of cooking.
6. Once cooked, remove the meatloaf from the Green Egg and allow it to rest for 10 minutes before slicing. This resting period ensures the juices redistribute throughout the meat, resulting in a moist and flavorful meatloaf.
7. Finally, serve slices of the meatloaf accompanied by your favorite sides such as mashed potatoes, roasted vegetables, or a fresh salad. Enjoy!

## Tips for Success

- For an extra burst of smoky flavor, consider adding wood chips or chunks to your Green Egg. Hickory, apple, or cherry wood all work wonderfully with meatloaf.
- Feel free to personalize your meatloaf by incorporating additional ingredients such as chopped bell peppers, shredded carrots, or diced mushrooms. Experiment with different spices and seasonings to suit your taste.
- Furthermore, you can mix different types of ground meat, such as beef and pork or beef and veal, to create a more complex flavor profile.

Now that you've mastered the art of cooking meatloaf on the Green Egg, it's time to impress your family and friends with this unique and irresistible dish. Whether you're hosting a backyard barbecue or simply enjoying a delicious meal, this recipe is guaranteed to elevate your grilling game. Get ready to savor the explosion of flavors and experience the ultimate joy of cooking on the Green Egg!

*Note: The cooking times provided are approximate and may vary depending on the size and thickness of the meatloaf. Always use a meat thermometer to ensure the meatloaf reaches a safe internal temperature of 160°F (71°C) before consuming.*
