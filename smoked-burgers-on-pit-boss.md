## Why Smoke Burgers?

Smoking burgers on a Pit Boss grill brings out a whole new level of flavor that you won't get with traditional grilling methods. The smoke infuses into the meat, giving it a rich and smoky taste that is hard to replicate. The slow cooking process also helps to retain moisture, resulting in juicy and tender burgers. If you are a fan of smoky flavors, then smoked burgers are a must-try!

## What You'll Need

To smoke burgers on a Pit Boss grill, you'll need the following ingredients and equipment:

### Ingredients:
- Ground beef (80% lean, 20% fat is ideal)
- Salt and pepper (to taste)
- Your favorite burger seasoning or spices

### Equipment:
- Pit Boss wood pellet grill
- Hardwood pellets (choose flavors like mesquite, hickory, or applewood for best results)
- Meat thermometer
- Grill brush
- Aluminum foil or grill mat

## Step-by-Step Guide to Smoking Burgers

### Step 1: Preparing the Patties
- Start by working the ground beef gently in a bowl, being careful not to overhandle it. Overworking the meat can result in tough and dry burgers.
- Shape the meat into equal-sized patties, about ¾ to 1 inch thick. Make a slight indentation in the center of each patty to prevent them from puffing up during cooking.
- Season the patties with salt, pepper, and any additional spices or burger seasoning you prefer. The seasoning will enhance the flavors and complement the smokiness.

### Step 2: Preparing the Grill
- Preheat your Pit Boss grill to 225-250°F (107-121°C), using hardwood pellets of your choice. Mesquite, hickory, or applewood are popular options for smoked burgers.
- Clean the grill grates using a grill brush to ensure they are free from any leftover residue.

### Step 3: Smoking the Burgers
- Place the seasoned burger patties directly on the preheated grill grates.
- Close the lid and let the burgers cook for approximately 1 to 1.5 hours, or until they reach an internal temperature of 160°F (71°C). This low and slow cooking method allows the burgers to absorb the smoky flavors.
- For added flavor, you can insert wood chips or chunks into the pellet hopper to intensify the smokiness. Experiment with different types of wood to find your favorite combination.

### Step 4: Adding Cheese (Optional)
- If you want to add cheese to your burgers, do so during the last 5 minutes of cooking. This will give the cheese enough time to melt and adhere to the patties.
- Close the lid and allow the cheese to melt while the burgers finish cooking.

### Step 5: Resting and Serving
- Once the burgers reach the desired internal temperature, remove them from the grill and let them rest for a few minutes.
- Resting allows the juices to redistribute, resulting in more succulent and flavorful burgers.
- Serve the smoked burgers on your favorite burger buns, along with your preferred toppings and condiments.
- Enjoy the delicious smokiness and savor the unique flavors that smoking brings to your burgers.

## Tips for Perfect Smoked Burgers

- Use quality ground beef with an 80% lean to 20% fat ratio. The fat adds moisture and flavor to the burgers, ensuring they stay juicy throughout the smoking process.
- Experiment with different seasonings and spices to create unique flavor combinations that suit your taste buds.
- Invest in a good meat thermometer to ensure your burgers are cooked to perfection. The internal temperature should reach 160°F (71°C) for medium doneness.
- Avoid opening the grill lid too frequently during the cooking process, as this can cause temperature fluctuations and increase cooking time.
