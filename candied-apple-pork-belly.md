## The Art of Preparing the Perfect Candied Apple Pork Belly

To start your culinary adventure, gather the following ingredients:

- 1.5-2 pounds of pork belly, skin-on
- 2 tablespoons of vegetable oil
- 1 large apple, peeled and thinly sliced
- 1 cup of apple juice
- 1/4 cup of brown sugar
- 2 tablespoons of soy sauce
- 2 tablespoons of honey
- 2 cloves of garlic, minced
- 1 teaspoon of fresh ginger, grated
- Salt and pepper to season

### Step 1: Preparing the Pork Belly

Begin by preheating your oven to 300°F (150°C). Place the pork belly on a cutting board, skin side up. Carefully score the skin diagonally using a sharp knife, making sure not to cut into the meat. Rub salt evenly over the skin and let it sit for a few minutes before proceeding.

### Step 2: Cooking the Pork Belly

Heat a large oven-safe skillet or roasting pan over medium-high heat and add the vegetable oil. Place the pork belly in the pan, skin side down, and sear for approximately 4-5 minutes until the skin turns golden brown and crispy. Flip the pork belly and cook for another 2 minutes.

### Step 3: Creating the Glaze

Remove the pork belly from the skillet and set it aside briefly. In the same skillet, add the apple slices, garlic, and ginger. Sauté them for a few minutes until they develop a slight golden color. Then, pour in the apple juice, brown sugar, soy sauce, and honey. Stir the mixture until the sugar has dissolved completely.

### Step 4: Assembling the Dish

Return the pork belly to the skillet, skin side up, nestled among the apple slices. Pour the glaze over the pork belly, ensuring it is evenly coated. Cover the skillet or roasting pan tightly with aluminum foil and transfer it to the preheated oven.

### Step 5: Baking and Glazing

Allow the candied apple pork belly to bake for approximately 2 hours. After the first hour, remove the foil and baste the pork belly with the glaze every 15-20 minutes to ensure a flavorful, caramelized coating.

### Step 6: Final Touches

Once the cooking time is up, carefully transfer the pork belly to a cutting board and let it rest for a few minutes. Slice it into mouthwatering portions and serve it with the caramelized apple slices, drizzling a little extra glaze on top for added indulgence.
